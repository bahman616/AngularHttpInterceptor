# AngularHttpInterceptor

This is a sample application demonstrating how to use angular HttpInterceptors to intercept Http requests and how to use this feature to show a spinner icon whenever there is a server request throughout the application. 

HttpInterceptor is based on <a href="https://github.com/mpalourdio/ng-http-loader">this</a>. 

## Development server

Run `npm start` to start the application. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
